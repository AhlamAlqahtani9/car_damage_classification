# Car Damage Classification
This project aims to automate car damage assessment using computer vision and deep learning techniques. 
A Kaggle dataset of 1,594 car damage images across seven categories is used. The project explores multiple approaches including a custom CNN and pre-trained models (EfficientNetB0, DenseNet201) with transfer learning. 
Key steps include data preprocessing, augmentation, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

Technologies:
- Python, Colab Notebook
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV

Outcome:
- DenseNet201 Fine-Tuning achieved the best classification accuracy (~88.5%)
- Demonstrates effective transfer learning for practical vehicle damage classification

This repository highlights skills in image processing, deep learning, transfer learning, and model evaluation.
